          "Springboks mastermind Rassie Erasmus has found support for his contentious latest tactics from Scott Robertson, even if the All Blacks coach suggests he’ll need to ring World Rugby to clarify their legality.",
          "Back-to-back World Cup-winning mentor Erasmus has owned the game when it comes to innovation on the rugby field, though last weekend took things to a new level in his side’s 45-0 win over Italy in Gqeberha.",
          "Having dismantled the Azzurri in the scrums the week prior, the South Africans deliberately put a player in front of the opening kickoff in order to concede a scrum at halfway (the laws don’t rule an offside in that instance). It didn’t work out – the hosts free-kicked for an early shove – and the Boks never got to kick another restart in the match to try it again.",
          "They continued to wow, with, not once, but twice, forming lineout-style maul plays in open play. Both times they earned penalty advantages, and then tries, with a move Erasmus admitted he copied off a local under-14 B side.",
          "Both bold ploys have stirred debate, including from retired referee Nigel Owens, who was labelled the maul tactic a “problem” due to the opposition not being able to compete to defend it, while indicating the kickoff manoeuvre should result in a penalty kick due to it intentionally infringing a law (as per law 9.7).",
          "Robertson’s take? Does he believe there is a place for such moves in the game, or is it pushing the boundaries too far?",
          "“It’s pretty unique, isn’t it, and, we’re talking about it, it’s great for our game,” the coach said yesterday ahead of his side’s third and final test against France on Saturday night, before revealing he had even been involved in a similar kickoff play during his playing career.",
          "“Yep, done it in my time in France, actually, at Perpignan, we had a hell of a scrum, kicked it out on the full, the forward pack were just standing behind the kicker [waiting for the scrum option to be taken at halfway].",
          "“So it’s not new. But it shows the intentions, doesn’t it? That’s the great thing about rugby, you can be innovative, you can use your strengths, and surprise people.”",
          "But will Erasmus be brave enough to bring those strategies to Eden Park, when the world’s top-two-ranked teams face-off in a Rugby Championship clash on the first Saturday in September?",
          "“Oh, you’ve got to consider everything,” said Robertson. “Yeah, I’m going to ring World Rugby,” he said with a laugh. “That’s one of those ones for interpretation, so we’ll see what the interpretation comes out like.”",
          "The All Blacks did produce a delightful piece of innovation themselves last Saturday, albeit a little less contentious, with their opening try in the 43-17 win in Wellington, where Cam Roigard scored down the sideline from a beautifully-worked dummy play off the back of a maul, in a move Robertson had credited newly recruited lineout coach Bryn Evans with.",
          "“It was cool. You’re always trying to find little ways to innovate and get one-onones and catch people by surprise. Something you haven’t seen is the hardest thing to defend, so what’s that little moment that you can catch them?”",
          "Meanwhile, with the series wrapped up, Robertson’s message is clear ahead of the third and final test of the series.",
          "“Keep performing, at the highest level, and show how much we care about our jersey,” he said, adding that he would still be looking to stay true to his pre-series plan of giving all squad members a run.",
          "That would see a debut for hooker Brodie McAlister, and second caps for halfback Noah Hotham and outside back Ruben Love, who are the only originally-picked players unaffected by injury yet to take the park, while injury-enforced late-addition prop George Bower could also come into contention.",
          "Prop Tyrel Lomax (calf), loose forward Luke Jacobson (concussion) and midfielder Anton Lienert-Brown (shoulder) are on track for their first action, while winger Sevu Reece is available again, following his first-minute concussion in the season-opener in Dunedin.",
          "Lock-turned blindside flanker Tupou Vaa’i, though, is out, Robertson confirmed, following his head knock in Wellington. Winger Caleb Clarke was set for 6-to-8 weeks on the sideline with the ankle injury sustained last week.",
