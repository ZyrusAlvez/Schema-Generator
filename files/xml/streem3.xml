        <story><![CDATA[Heartbreaking vision has captured a struggling dolphin on an Adelaide beach as members of the public rushed to help.
Beachgoers raised the alarm just after 9am on Sunday after spotting the dolphin in the shallows.
Rescuers tried to help it back into deeper water but it kept returning to the shore.
Marine experts and a vet were called in to help, but the decision was made to euthanise after a couple of hours.
Fishing videographer AlexsFishin captured the distressing scene, calling for more awareness about the algae bloom sweeping across the state.
â€œThis is not what you want to see going for a beach stroll before work,â€ he said in an Instagram post. â€œSouth Australia's gulfs have been suffering from a disaster, this video has been posted to spread awareness.â€
Kerryn Suthern, who tried to rescue the dolphin, said the animal was â€œclearly very sick, distressed and any prolonging of its situation would have been traumatisingâ€.
The latest incident comes amid a toxic algae bloom in the state.
