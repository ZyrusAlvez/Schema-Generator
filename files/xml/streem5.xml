        <story><![CDATA[The Coalition will back reforms to childcare introduced by the government in the wake of a series of alleged incidents at daycare centres.
Opposition education spokesman Jonathon Duniam said â€œwe are calling on the government to act with haste to improve our broken childcare systemâ€.
The childcare reform bill passed the lower house soon after and can pass the senate this week.
The reforms were expedited after Melbourne childcare worker Joshua Dale Brown was charged with more than 70 offences, including sexual activity in the presence of a child under 16, sexual assault of a child under 16 and possessing child abuse material. He has yet to enter pleas.
Labor's bill proposes to strip childcare centres of federal funding if they do not meet the National Quality Standards for safety and quality.
Centres that put kids at risk are in danger of having their funding totally cut. Any illegal activity would also be grounds to lose public funding.
Government staff will also be given the power to do unannounced spot-checks.
Education ministers will meet in August to discuss a national register of early childhood educators. The state, territory and federal Attorney-Generals will also discuss working with children check reforms.]]></story>
