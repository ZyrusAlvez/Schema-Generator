<story><![CDATA[The fourth edition of The Straits Times' â€œConversations with STâ€ engagement series took place on the evening of July 29, bringing together about 70 business executives to discuss how small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can gain more effective media exposure.

Held at The Great Room in Centennial Tower, the event was organised in partnership with the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME) and is part of ST's ongoing 180th anniversary celebrations.

The evening opened with a panel discussion featuring ST editor Jaime Ho, deputy business editor Kang Wan Chern, ST Now assistant editor Lim Say Heng and ASME president Ang Yuit. The session was moderated by associate editor (newsroom strategy) Jeremy Au Yong.

Mr Ang noted that SMEs make up 99 per cent of businesses and employ over 70 per cent of the workforce in Singapore. He encouraged SME leaders to see media beyond the context of crisis management and to view media coverage as a way to build brand visibility.

Mr Ho highlighted the importance of such dialogues in shaping newsroom direction. He said he hoped that the session would both answer SME leaders' questions and gather feedback on how ST can evolve to better serve readers.

The panel discussed topics including how SMEs can increase their chances of being covered by the media and how to pitch sustainability stories amid concerns surrounding greenwashing.

Following the format introduced in previous sessions, the participants broke into small groups for indepth discussions with ST editors and journalists. The theme of the evening, â€œThe Business of Being Seenâ€, guided conversations around pitching strategies - from moving beyond announcements to positioning a brand as a thought leader. The participants also discussed how SMEs can collaborate to strengthen story angles.

Mr Salahuddin Basheer, director at consumer goods company Alfa Tradelinks, attended the session to improve his branding strategy. Instead, he walked away with broader insights. He noted that SMEs and the media have a two-way relationship where SMEs need media exposure, and the media needs newsmakers like SMEs. It is about how both parties can communicate for mutual benefit, he said.

Tong Seng Produce marketing director Ally Ng said the opportunity to connect directly with journalists was invaluable. The editors â€œwere very real in giving feedbackâ€, she said. She joined the session hoping to get insights on promoting her company's sustainability efforts, and she learnt that pitches need to take into account audience readiness and frame environmental messages in ways that resonate with readers.

The session achieved its objective of bridging the gap between running a business and telling its story well, said Mr Ang. â€œOur members leave today equipped with the strategic confidence to turn their operational successes into compelling narratives that build credibility and drive growth.â€
