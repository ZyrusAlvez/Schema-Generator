        <story><![CDATA[Sir Michael Hill, owner of the multimillion-dollar jewellery chain of the same name, has died aged 86.
The entrepreneur, who stepped down from the board of his jewellery company in April to undergo treatment for cancer, died on Tuesday.
The millionaire entrepreneur and philanthropist was born in New Zealand in 1938.
He was raised in Whangarei, on New Zealand's North Island, and attended Whangarei Boys' High School until age 16.
Shortly after founding his own business alongside his wife Christine in 1979, Sir Michael decided they should expand into the Australian market.
â€œWhat began as a job soon became a passion. Sir Michael had a natural gift for storytelling, a keen eye for visual merchandising and an instinct for attracting customers and a gift for selling,â€ a company spokesman said.
Michael Hill International owns 302 stores globally, with total revenue in 2024 of almost $650m. Its jewellery has been worn by some of the world's most famous celebrities, including Miranda Kerr.
Sir Michael is survived by wife, Lady Christine, and children Mark and Emma.
