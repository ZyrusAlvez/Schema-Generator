        <subheadline><![CDATA[Canberra reiterates tariff stance amid latest US threat]]></subheadline>        <story><![CDATA[Australia has reiterated the need for free trade amid President Donald Trump's latest plan to hike tariffs on all imports to the US.
Health Minister Mark Butler said the Albanese Government would continue to make the case for the removal of all tariffs on Australia, but was seeking clarity on Mr Trump's intent after the US President floated the idea of lifting the current 10 per cent baseline tariff on all nations to between 15 and 20 per cent.
Mr Butler said US signals on trade had been volatile in recent weeks, including in relation to Mr Trump's suggestion tariffs of up to 200 per cent would be slapped on all pharmaceutical imports to the US within the next two years.
â€œThe nature of some of these trade positions from the US administration - I've found that the position in relation to pharmaceuticals has changed a lot over the last couple of weeks - the nature, the timing, the scale of tariffs that might be imposed not just on Australia but on pharmaceutical imports to the US from anywhere in the world,â€ Mr Butler said.
â€œSo we're trying to make sure that we have a sense of what the US administration is planning but continuing nonetheless to prosecute Australia's national interest and reinforce the importance of free trade.â€
Speaking in Scotland, Mr Trump said he was planning a new tariff for â€œthe worldâ€ and when asked how high it would be he said: â€œI would say it'll be somewhere in the 15 to 20 per cent rangeâ€.
â€œI just want to be nice,â€ he said. â€œProbably one of those two numbers.â€
Most nations, including Australia, face a baseline rate of 10 per cent, though Mr Trump announced higher â€œreciprocalâ€ tariffs for many countries in April.
But since then there has been a series of rolling pauses on those taking effect as the US negotiates with its trading partners.
Coalition trade spokesman Kevin Hogan said tariffs were â€œbad policyâ€ and threatened to lower global growth.
â€œAustralia sold $650bn of goods and services overseas last year,â€ he said. â€œThis reinforces the importance of PM Albanese securing a face-toface meeting with the US President.â€
Mr Trump's announcement targeted â€œessentially, the rest of the worldâ€, possibly meaning nations that were yet to finalise a deal with the US.
â€œThat's what they're going to pay if they want to do business in the United States, because you can't sit down and make 200 deals,â€ he said.
